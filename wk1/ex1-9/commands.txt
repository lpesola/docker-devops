This container makes available the libcoap C library 
Libcoap is a minimal library supporting the new CoAP IoT protocol
It doesn't require much, just C support and a few tools like automake
This can be used to compile C programs that require the use of the libcoap library
Currently it's not the smoothest thing to use but does what it's supposed to do. 
Requires a volume that is accessible to the container.

Build the container
➜  wlgs git:(master) ✗ docker build -t libcoap .

Usage
➜  wlgs git:(master) ✗ docker run -v "$(pwd)":/opt/output libcoap /opt/output/client.c -o client.out
Mounts the current directory as /opt/output which can then be used to compile programs

This can be tested with the example apps from https://github.com/obgm/libcoap
